\paragraph*{}\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{ocre!60} R}{eal} estate appraisal, which is the process of estimating the price for real estate properties, is crucial for both buys and sellers as the basis for negotiation and transaction. Traditionally, the repeat sales model has been widely adopted to estimate real estate price. However, it depends the design and calculation of a complex economic related index, which is challenging to estimate accurately. Today, real estate brokers provide easy access to detailed online information on real estate properties to their clients. We are interested in estimating the real estate price from these large amounts of easily accessed data. In particular, we analyze the prediction power of online house pictures, which is one of the key factors for online users to make a potential visiting decision. The development of robust computer vision algorithms makes the analysis of visual content possible. In this work, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict real estate price using the state-of-the-art visual features.\\
In a smart city, effective and accurate real estate assessments governed by a local government is crucial for determining the property taxes. Such assessments have never been trivial, and inappropriate assessments may result in disputes between property owners and the local government.\\
Generally for price prediction \textbf{\color{ocre} Regression} is used (Prediction of continuos valued-function). But here we are going to use \textbf{\color{ocre} Structured Deep Neural Network} in order to improve efficiency and accuracy. We introduce a deep learning approach to smartly and effectively assessing real estate values. We propose a systematic method to derive a layered knowledge graph and design a structured Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on it. Neurons in a structured DNN are structurally connected, which makes the network time and space efficient; and thus, it requires fewer data points for training. The structured DNN model has been designed to learn from the most recently captured data points; therefore, it allows the model to adapt to the latest market trends.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Project Idea}
\paragraph*{} Real estate appraisal, which is the process of estimating the price for real estate properties.\\
A report published by EPRA(\emph{Europian Public Real Estate Association}) real estate in all its forms accounts approximately 18-20 percent of its economical activity.therefore accurate prediction of real estete properties are crucial. For most of the working classes housing has been one of the largest expense, so to make right decision on the real estate investment is much cruicial.


\section{Motivation of the Project}  
\paragraph*{}  As we seen the report published by EPRA and why investment in  housing 
is important the thats why accurate preduction of real estate properties are crucial.Traditionally previous work for  prediction of price is based on regression analysis and machine learning.but due to rapid development in Deep Neural Network feild it is much benificial to use DNN instead of Regression.Beacuse of recently developed deep learning,computer becomes smart enough to interpret visual content in similar way that human can.\\
peoples can able to estimate price more accurately in this system as compared to previous systems only because of DNN.

The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds.\textbf{Scrum} is a framework for Agile software development.

\subsubsection{Description}
\paragraph*{}
In this algorithm we take the training and testing dataset as the input and construct a Knowledge Graph from it. Firstly in this we initialize the DNN which has k layers and n(i) neurons in each layer.  Then we train DNN using the training dataset which we have taken as input. And similarly we test the DNN using the testing dataset. At this point we record its accuracy. After training and testing the DNN, we identify the weak links, weak neurons and the weak layers .So basically the weak links are the weights are the links with weak weights that are below the predefined threshold. We delete these weak links from the DNN. Then we identify weak neurons; these are the neurons with very few links, such links can also be deleted from the DNN. Or such neurons can be combined into a stronger one .After this we examine the hidden layers with very few neurons, which are called the weak layers. In a similar way we can delete the weak layer or combine two adjacent weak layers into a single one. After removal of all the outliers we again train the DNN using the training dataset and test the DNN using the testing dataset and we once again record the accuracy. We restore the resultant DNN which is a structured with no weak links or weak neurons or weak layers and we name the hidden nodes and adjust the DNN accordingly. Then we create a graph which is the layered Knowledge Graph.

\subsection{Data Collectin and Preprocessing}
We collected real estate data from a real estate website Zillow.com. This website conserves all recent and past house listings data including house features, market features, public records of houses, neighborhood features, etc. An entire number of 15 features are predefined and their associated values are collected. The predefined features include number of beds, number of baths, square footage, lot size, built year, yearly tax, similar houses average sold price, adjacent schools average ratings, fireplace, waterfront, the number of stories, heating, cooling, patio, and park. In our approach, we first remove the following outliers:  First is data points with insufficient information, e.g., missing square footage. And second is data points with unreasoning values such as a sold price of 1 as a gift. We additional calculate the average selling price of houses sold in last few months. Houses with too high or too low price-per-square feet are considered all outliers, and thus they are omitted from the training datasets and test datasets.


\subsection{Layered Knowledge Graph}
 A knowledge graph is a graph with entities of different types as nodes and several relations between them as edges. Knowledge graph aims to represent entities and the relations between entities.  We consider that a Deep Neural Network, which can produce suitable outputs with fewer weak connections between the neurons, would be nearer to a representation of a knowledge graph in a given field. We have selected a fully connected DNN with 2 hidden layers and 12 neurons in each hidden layer for our case study. In this selected neural network, the input layer contains 15 neurons, representing the predefined input features for house cost assessments, and a single output neuron representing the assessed house value or predicted selling price. We derived a layered knowledge graph for the real estate domain. We can see that the first layer contains 15 input nodes indicating that all selected features have important influences on house price assessments. The total number of hidden neurons in the second and third layer has been reduced from 12 to 10 and 7, respectively. This is due to the weak links and weak neurons being removed from the network. Finally, a single neuron in the last layer represents the assessed house value or predicted selling price
 
 
 \subsection{\color{ocre} Structured DNN}
 A deep neural network is a type of neural network in which there exist a certain level of complexity. It is a neural network with more than two layers. The structured DNN is considered to match with the knowledge graph. We made experiments on fully-connected DNNs with different numbers of hidden layers and different numbers of neurons in each hidden layer. The structured Deep Neural Network has four layers such as an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. We set up suitable hyper-parameters for the structured DNN, and trained it using algorithm such as standard feed forward and back propagation algorithm with problem-specific real-time training and fitting techniques. Note that the first layer of the network contains 15 input neurons, which always produce outputs, as there are no biases are connected to the input layer neurons. Even though minor initialized weights create a neural network learn slowly, with sufficient offered data points, adjust a deep neural network with lesser weights which will help to get improved generalization, so to get good performance.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}
\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{ocre} P}{redictive} analytic has become more and more important in the world of big data and machine learning. Here for prediction purpose we are going to use Deep Neural network instead of Regression analysis. Due to the large size of a deep learning architecture, deep learning typically requires a large amount of data to train the model, which makes the training process very time and space inefficient. In addition, a large deep architecture may also prone to have the over-fitting issue.Our experimental results given in research paper show that the proposed approach outperforms other conventional methods and leading real estate companies such as \emph{Zillow} and \emph{Redfin}, with significantly improved accuracy for house-price prediction.

\subparagraph*{}
For future research, we will study how to automate the process of extracting layered knowledge graphs from the real estate domain based on historical data, and design structured DNNs using the graphs. We will allow a DNN model to automatically change its network structure along the time, so it can be more scalable and better adapt to new market changes. Furthermore, we plan to implement our approach using mobile cloud computing. that supports assessments of real estate via mobile devices with computation functions deployed in the clouds. Finally, we will try to apply our approach to predictive analytic problems from other domains. such as stock market, health-care, transportation, marketing, e-commerce, security, business, and many more.
